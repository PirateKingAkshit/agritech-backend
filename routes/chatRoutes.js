/**
 * ============================================
 * CHAT ROUTES
 * ============================================
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * Defines all REST API endpoints for the chat system.
 * These are HTTP endpoints used by Flutter and Next.js frontends.
 * 
 * ROUTE PREFIX: /api/v1/chat
 * (All routes below are prefixed with /api/v1/chat in app.js)
 * 
 * AUTHENTICATION:
 * All routes require valid JWT token in Authorization header
 * 
 * USED BY:
 * - Flutter mobile app (User/farmers)
 * - Next.js web dashboard (Support/Admin)
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * Real-time messaging uses Socket.IO (see chatSocket.js)
 * These HTTP routes are for:
 * - Initial data loading
 * - Pagination
 * - Non-real-time operations
